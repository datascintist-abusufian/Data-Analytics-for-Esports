# Data-analytics-for-Esports
With the help of data-driven technology like Python, this project will evaluate the E-Gaming dataset from the previous few years in order to derive insights and create predictive models. 
The dataset includes a variety of E-Gaming-related features, such as game names, teams, participants, prize money, and tournament locations. 
Different visualisations are used in the project to better understand the patterns in the data and statistical tests are used to establish the correlation between these features. 
In order to predict the future based on the data, the project also contains a regression model. Various accuracy metrics are applied to the findings to validate the model's accuracy.
This project gives insightful knowledge into the world of electronic gaming and is a helpful tool for identifying potential future trends.
